**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The 2022 Cooperative Election Study (CES) dataset was created to study American voters' electoral behavior, political opinions, and experiences, with a focus on understanding representation and accountability during elections. It specifically aims to provide large-scale, representative data on voter preferences and behaviors across legislative constituencies, addressing the need for comprehensive datasets that capture both state and national dynamics.
    
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The CES dataset is a collaborative effort led by principal investigators Stephen Ansolabehere (Harvard University), Brian Schaffner (Tufts University), and Marissa Shih (YouGov), involving 60 research teams and organizations. It is conducted under the broader framework of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, which was renamed the Cooperative Election Study in 2020.
    
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The creation of the dataset was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award #2148907. Additional research support was provided by Harvard University, Tufts University, and other participating universities and organizations.

4. *Any other comments?*
    - The CES dataset is part of an ongoing series of election studies initiated in 2006. It employs advanced sampling and weighting techniques to ensure a high level of accuracy and representativeness. The dataset is a valuable tool for scholars, policymakers, and analysts, offering detailed insights into voter behavior and public opinion trends across diverse demographic groups and political contexts.


**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The dataset comprises survey responses from U.S. residents regarding their voting behavior, political opinions, demographic characteristics, and contextual information about electoral districts. The dataset includes multiple types of instances, such as individual respondents, their answers to survey questions, and validated voter records. Relationships between instances, such as geographical or demographic correlations, are also embedded within the data.


2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset contains responses from approximately 60,000 individuals, divided between pre-election and post-election waves, representing one of the largest sample sizes for such studies.

3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample drawn using matched sampling techniques to ensure representativeness of the U.S. adult population. It aligns with demographic and voter registration distributions based on sources like the American Community Survey and voter files. Geographic and demographic balancing was validated through weighting and comparisons to actual election results.


4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of processed survey responses, including demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, race, education), political preferences (e.g., party affiliation, policy support), and voting behavior (e.g., voter turnout, candidate selection). Contextual data about electoral districts and representatives are also included.

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Some instances include targets, such as validated voter turnout or party preference, which can be used for predictive modeling and analysis.


6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances may have missing responses due to participant non-response or skipped questions. For validated voter records, unmatched respondents may lack certain data due to incomplete or inaccurate registration information.


7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships between instances, such as demographic clustering, geographical distribution, and voting trends, are captured through variables like state, congressional district, and demographic attributes.


8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- The dataset is often divided into pre-election and post-election waves, and weights (e.g., commonweight, vvweight) are provided for analyses targeting different populations (e.g., registered voters, validated voters).


9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Errors may arise from self-reported data (e.g., misreporting) and sample matching (e.g., unmatched voter records). These are mitigated through validation and weighting techniques.


10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset relies on external voter file data for validation (e.g., TargetSmart), which is integrated into the dataset with weights and additional variables. Archival versions are maintained, but external dependencies may evolve over time.


11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset does not contain legally confidential data but includes anonymized voter registration and demographic details to preserve respondent privacy.


12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- Survey questions and responses may touch on sensitive topics, such as political opinions, voting rights, and demographic factors, which could evoke strong reactions or discomfort among some audiences.


13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Sub-populations are identified through demographic variables such as age, gender, race, and political affiliation. Distributions are adjusted to ensure representativeness of these groups within the overall sample.


14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- The dataset is anonymized to prevent direct identification of individuals. However, indirect identification risks exist if combined with other datasets containing overlapping variables.


15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset includes sensitive information, such as political opinions, party affiliation, race, ethnicity, and demographic variables. These are anonymized to ensure data security.


16. *Any other comments?*
	- The CES dataset provides a rich source for understanding voter behavior and preferences, with built-in safeguards for confidentiality and representativeness. It supports both exploratory analyses and targeted research on U.S. electoral dynamics. Further information can be found in the CES [FAQs](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/frequently-asked-questions).


**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data was collected through surveys conducted by YouGov using its matched random sample methodology. Respondents were recruited from opt-in internet panels, and their survey responses were directly reported. The data was validated by matching to TargetSmart's voter database to verify voter registration and turnout records.
	
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- Surveys were administered online using YouGov’s platform. Respondents were matched to a target sample based on demographic, geographic, and voter data variables derived from high-quality datasets, including the American Community Survey (ACS) and voter registration files. Matching was validated using weighted Euclidean distance metrics to ensure representativeness.


3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- A stratified sampling approach was used. The sample was matched to a politically representative modeled frame based on variables such as age, gender, race, and education. Weighting adjusted for imbalances to ensure representativeness of U.S. adults and registered voters.


4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- Respondents were recruited from opt-in panels provided by YouGov and other partner organizations. Compensation details were managed by YouGov but typically included incentives customary for panel participation, such as monetary rewards or points.


5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- Data collection occurred in two waves: pre-election (September 29 – November 8, 2022) and post-election (November 10 – December 15, 2022). Validation was completed in August 2023.
